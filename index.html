    Pikachu is a small, yellow, mouse-like creature with black-tipped ears and a lightning bolt-shaped tail. Its round, chubby cheeks are a rosy red color and often spark with electricity. It has large, innocent-looking eyes and a cute, almost childlike appearance. Pikachu's fur is soft and fuzzy, giving it a huggable quality that only adds to its charm. <br>
    <br>
    Despite its adorable appearance, Pikachu is a fierce fighter with lightning-fast reflexes and powerful electric attacks. When it becomes angry or threatened, its cheeks crackle with electricity, warning its opponents of the danger they face. In battle, Pikachu moves with agility and grace. <br>

    In battles, Pikachu's signature move is Thunderbolt, which unleashes a powerful bolt of electricity that can stun and damage its opponents.
